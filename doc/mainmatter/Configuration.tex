\section{Configuration}
\label{sec:configuration}

anysyncd is configured in an ini-style configuration file \texttt{/etc/anysyncd/anysyncd.ini},
with sections for each sync directory and a section named 'global' for global
settings. 

An example of that configuration file is delivered with the software
itself and usually installed to the system-specific directories (e.g.
/usr/share/doc/anysyncd/examples on Debian-based systems).

Every directory that shall be synchronized by anysyncd reflects a section in
the configuration file. The name for those sections can be chosen arbitrarily
(within the rules given by the ini-style-format), but it is recommended to
chose it wisely, since it is used in the log message of the daemon. Its
configuration keys may vary, depending on the chosen syncer, which are described
in section \ref{sec:syncers}.
