The following packages are needed in Debian (wheezy) to build this template:
* make
* latexmk
* latex-xcolor
* lmodern
* pgf
* texlive-latex-recommended
* texlive-fonts-recommended
* texlive-latex-extra
* texlive-lang-german

The draftwatermark package in the texlive-latex-extra of Debian squeeze does
not support the "final" nor "nostamp" options and thus does not get disabled
by using those as document class options.
